# Task Creation Implementation Details

The current implementation of the task creation interaction follows the guidelines in `task-creation.md`, providing an efficient way for users to create new tasks.

**Current Implementation:**

## Entry Points

Task creation can be initiated through multiple paths:

1. **Global Add Button:**
   - Located in the top right corner of the TitleBar
   - Consistently available across all views
   - Uses a plus icon for universal recognition

2. **Calendar Day Click:**
   - In calendar view, clicking on any day opens the creation form
   - Pre-fills the date field based on the selected day
   - Simplifies task scheduling

## Modal Implementation

The task creation form is implemented as a modal dialog:

1. **Visual Design:**
   - Clean white background with rounded corners and subtle shadow
   - Clear title ("New Todo" or "Edit Todo")
   - Close button in the upper right
   - Submit button with clear label and icon

2. **Form Elements:**
   - Title field: Primary input with autofocus
   - Due date picker: Optional date selection
   - All-day toggle: Switch component for date-only tasks
   - Time picker: Conditionally shown when all-day is off

3. **Interaction States:**
   - Submit button is disabled until title is entered
   - Form fields have appropriate focus states
   - Toggle switches provide immediate visual feedback

## User Flow

The task creation flow is streamlined:

1. User clicks an entry point to open the modal
2. Modal appears with an animated entrance
3. User enters task title and optional date/time
4. User submits the form or cancels
5. Modal closes with an animated exit
6. On submission, the new task appears in the appropriate view

## Technical Implementation

1. **Component Structure:**
   - `TodoForm.tsx` handles both creation and editing
   - Modal rendering is managed by the `EntityView` component
   - Form state is controlled through React hooks

2. **State Management:**
   - Form data is managed with local state
   - Creation is handled by the `useCreateTodo` mutation
   - UI state (modal open/closed) is tracked in `useUiStore`

3. **Styling Approach:**
   - Tailwind styled components for consistent design
   - Responsive design adjusts for different screen sizes
   - Focus management ensures keyboard accessibility

## Success & Error Handling

The implementation includes proper feedback mechanisms:

1. **Success:**
   - The new task appears immediately in the list
   - The task is visually highlighted briefly to draw attention
   - The modal automatically closes upon successful creation

2. **Error:**
   - Form validation prevents submission of incomplete tasks
   - API errors are captured and displayed appropriately
   - Network issues are handled gracefully
