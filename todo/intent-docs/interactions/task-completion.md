# Task Completion Interaction Intent

**Purpose:**

To provide a clear, satisfying, and easily reversible way for users to mark tasks as complete (or incomplete) with rich visual feedback that communicates the state change.

**Overall Interaction Goals:**

* **Multiple Visual Indicators:** The task's completion state is reflected through several coordinated visual changes.
* **Immediate Feedback:** The task item visibly changes state instantly upon completion.
* **Effortless Action:** Completing a task requires minimal effort (single click/tap).
* **Clear Distinction:** Completed tasks are immediately distinguishable from incomplete tasks.

**Visual Elements & Changes:**

* **Completion Indicator:**
  * Incomplete: Empty circle icon in gray that turns blue on hover
  * Complete: Green checkmark icon inside a circle

* **Task Card Styling:**
  * Incomplete: White background with border and subtle shadow
  * Complete: Light gray background with border and subtle shadow

* **Task Title:**
  * Incomplete: Dark gray, normal text
  * Complete: Medium gray text with strikethrough

* **Status Tag:**
  * Incomplete: Blue "Todo" pill
  * Complete: Green "Done" pill

**Interaction Flow:**

1. User clicks/taps the circle icon on an incomplete task
2. The following changes occur simultaneously:
   * Circle icon transforms to a green checkmark
   * Card background changes from white to light gray
   * Title text receives strikethrough and changes color
   * "Todo" tag changes to a "Done" tag
3. To undo, user clicks the green checkmark icon
4. All visual elements revert to their incomplete state

**Hover States:**

* The completion indicator shows a color change on hover (gray to blue)
* This provides a clear affordance that the element is interactive

**Accessibility Considerations:**

* The completion state is communicated through multiple visual channels (icon, color, text style)
* Color is not the sole indicator of state changes

**Style and Feel:**

* Satisfying
* Comprehensive
* Clear
* Reversible
* Modern
