# View Transitions Interaction Intent

**Purpose:**

To provide a smooth, coherent, and visually pleasing experience when switching between different views of the todo list (list, board, calendar, etc.). Transitions should minimize disorientation and maintain a sense of context for the user.

**Overall Interaction Goals:**

*   **Smoothness:** Transitions should be fluid and visually appealing, avoiding abrupt changes.
*   **Context Preservation:** The user should understand how the new view relates to the previous one.
*   **Performance:** Transitions should be performant, without introducing noticeable lag.
*   **Clarity:** It should be immediately obvious which view the user is currently in.

**Visual Elements & Intent:**

*   **View Selection Controls:** Tabs, buttons, dropdown menus that allow the user to switch between views. These should be clearly labeled and visually distinct. The current selected element should be highlighted.
*   **Loading Indicator (if needed):** Show a progress bar or spinner if loading a new view takes time.
*   **Transition Animations:** Subtle animations to visually connect the views, showing how tasks are re-organized or re-represented.

**Transition Techniques:**

*   **Fade In/Out:** The current view fades out while the new view fades in. Simple and effective.
*   **Slide In/Out:** The new view slides in from the side, pushing the old view out. Gives a sense of movement and direction.
*   **Morphing (Advanced):** (Potentially using React Shared Element Transitions) Task items morph in their position/size based on the new view. Provides a stronger sense of visual continuity.

**Specific Considerations per Transition:**

*   **List to Board:** Tasks could slide horizontally to their column based on completion state.
*   **Board to Calendar:** Tasks expand to the calendar day or collapse to a small indicator on a particular day.
*   **Calendar to List:** Expand only the tasks for the current week or Month.

**Interaction Flow:**

1.  The user clicks on a view selection control (tab, button, dropdown item).
2.  The application visually transitions from the current view to the selected view using a smooth animation.
3.  The view selection control clearly reflects the new view state (e.g., highlighted tab).

**Variations & Considerations:**

*   **Mobile:** Use full-screen transitions or bottom sheet transitions to better utilize screen space.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure transitions are accessible to users with motion sensitivities (provide an option to disable animations).

**Style and Feel:**

*   Smooth
*   Connected
*   Modern
*   Intuitive
*   Dynamic
