# View Transitions Implementation Details

The current implementation of view transitions follows the intent outlined in `view-transitions.md`, providing a smooth experience when switching between different views of the todo list.

**Current Implementation:**

## Transition Types

The application implements several types of transitions between views:

1. **Cross-Fade Transitions:**
   - When switching between major view types (list, board, calendar)
   - Subtle opacity changes create a smooth visual transition
   - Duration is set to 300ms with an ease-in-out timing function

2. **Layout Transitions:**
   - When the sidebar collapses or expands
   - Content area adjusts smoothly to the new available space
   - Uses CSS transitions for width/margin changes

3. **UI Element Transitions:**
   - Title bar slides up/down based on scroll position
   - View selectors highlight with color changes and underlines
   - Navigation elements use hover and active states for feedback

## Implementation Details

### Navigation Structure

1. **View Selection:**
   - Tab-based navigation in the UI store manages current view state
   - `setCurrentView` function handles transitions between views
   - Sub-views (like calendar month/week/day) have their own state management

2. **Route-Based Navigation:**
   - Different views are accessible through URL routes
   - Route changes trigger view transitions automatically
   - Browser history is properly maintained for back/forward navigation

### Technical Approach

1. **State Management:**
   - `useUiStore` Zustand store manages the current view state
   - View changes trigger re-renders with appropriate transitions
   - Layout adjustments respond to both view changes and screen size

2. **Responsive Behavior:**
   - Mobile view uses different transition patterns
   - Sidebar becomes a slide-in panel on smaller screens
   - Touch-friendly interactions are prioritized on mobile devices

3. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Transitions are hardware-accelerated when possible
   - Heavy animations are avoided during data loading
   - Key frames are optimized for smooth performance

## Specific View Transitions

### List to Board Transition:
- Tasks maintain their relative position during transition
- Status-based grouping becomes visually apparent
- The transition emphasizes the organizational change

### Board to Calendar Transition:
- Tasks visually reorient to their temporal positioning
- Date context becomes the primary organizational method
- Visual continuity is maintained through consistent task card styling

### Calendar View Type Transitions:
- Month/week/day transitions maintain date context
- The selected date remains in focus during transitions
- Level of detail increases/decreases smoothly

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the current implementation:

1. **Shared Element Transitions:**
   - Implement true morphing of elements between views
   - Task cards could visually travel to their new positions

2. **Animation Preferences:**
   - Respect user preferences for reduced motion
   - Provide settings to adjust transition speed and behavior

3. **Loading States:**
   - Enhance transition handling during data fetching
   - Implement skeleton screens for smoother perceived performance
