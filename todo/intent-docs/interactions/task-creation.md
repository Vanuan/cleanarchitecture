# Task Creation Interaction Intent

**Purpose:**

To enable users to quickly and easily add new tasks to their Todo list. The interaction should feel efficient, intuitive, and non-disruptive to their workflow.

**Overall Interaction Goals:**

*   **Speed:** Adding a task should be as quick as possible.
*   **Simplicity:** The process should be straightforward and easy to understand.
*   **Minimal Disruption:** Avoid interrupting the user's existing workflow.
*   **Clarity:** The user should clearly understand what they are adding and how to configure it.

**Visual Elements & Intent:**

*   **Add Task Button/Icon:** Located in a prominent but unobtrusive location (e.g., top right of the screen, bottom right as a FAB). Its visual should clearly indicate its purpose (e.g., a "+" icon).
*   **Task Creation Form (Modal or Inline):**
    *   **Title Field:** The primary input for the task description, should be clear and prominent.
    *   **Due Date Picker (Optional):** Easy-to-use date and time selection (if available). Should allow the task to be an 'all-day' task.
    *   **Tag Input (Optional):** A way to quickly add tags, potentially with auto-completion. Should allow easy entering of bracketed `[tags]`
    *   **Submit Button:** Clearly labeled ("Add Task," "Create," etc.).
    *   **Cancel/Close Button:** Clear way to dismiss the form.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Clear confirmation that the task has been created (e.g., the task appearing in the list or board, a brief success message).

**Interaction Flow (Modal):**

1.  User clicks/taps the "Add Task" button/icon.
2.  A modal window or overlay appears, containing the task creation form.
3.  User enters the task title and optionally sets a due date and tags.
4.  User clicks "Submit" to create the task, or "Cancel" to dismiss the form.
5.  The modal window closes, and the new task is displayed in the appropriate view (list, board, etc.).

**Interaction Flow (Inline):**

1. User sees an always-available "Add task" field at the bottom of the list.
2. User adds task, and the view updates when the return key is pressed.

**Variations & Considerations:**

*   **Mobile:** Use a bottom sheet or full-screen modal for task creation.
*   **Desktop:** A smaller pop-up or slide-in form might be more appropriate.

**Style and Feel:**

*   Efficient
*   Clear
*   Unobtrusive
*   Simple
*   Direct
