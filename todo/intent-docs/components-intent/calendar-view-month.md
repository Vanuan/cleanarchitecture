# Calendar View Component Intent - Month View

**Purpose:**

To provide a comprehensive monthly overview of tasks and events organized in a traditional calendar grid, allowing users to see their schedule distribution across an entire month at a glance.

**Visual Goals:**

* **Organized Grid Layout:** Present days in a clean, structured grid with clear delineation of weeks.
* **Visual Task Indicators:** Show task presence through subtle, colorful indicators without overwhelming detail.
* **Current Day Highlighting:** Clearly identify the current day for immediate temporal context.
* **Month Navigation:** Allow easy movement between months with visual indicators of relative time.
* **Consistent Design:** Maintain visual cohesion with other calendar views.

**Key Elements & Intent:**

* **View Selector:**
  * Three-segment control for switching between Month, Week, and Day views
  * Month view highlighted with gradient text and bottom border
  * Clean typography and equal spacing

* **Month Navigation Row:**
  * Multiple months displayed with current month highlighted
  * Previous/Next arrows for navigation between months
  * Year indicator above month names
  * Labels like "This Month," "Next Month" for context
  * Visual distinction for current month (gradient text and bottom border)

* **Day Name Headers:**
  * Monday through Sunday headers at the top of the grid
  * Consistent styling with medium font weight
  * Clear visual separation from the date grid

* **Calendar Grid:**
  * 5-6 rows depending on the month's structure
  * 7 columns representing days of the week
  * Current day highlighted with a colored border
  * Previous/next month dates shown in light gray
  * Each day cell showing the date number and any scheduled tasks

* **Task Indicators:**
  * Color gradient pills showing number of tasks
  * Subtle background coloring that doesn't overwhelm the grid
  * Text showing task count when multiple tasks exist

* **Controls & Navigation:**
  * "Today" button with gradient background for returning to current date
  * Previous/Next navigation for moving between months
  * Month name selector for jumping to specific months

**Visual Implementation Details:**

* **Month Navigation:**
  * Month tabs showing 5 consecutive months
  * Current month highlighted with gradient text and bottom border
  * Year displayed above month names
  * Relative time labels ("This Month", "Next Month") below month names
  * Previous/Next arrows with divider lines

* **Calendar Legend:**
  * Small color indicator matching task pills
  * Text explanation of indicators
  * Helper text for interaction guidance

* **Calendar Grid Design:**
  * Clean white background with subtle gray borders
  * Day cells with sufficient height for content (~24px)
  * Consistent internal padding within cells
  * Previous/next month dates in light gray to reduce visual prominence
  * Current day with colored top border for emphasis

* **Task Representation:**
  * Gradient-colored pill showing task count
  * Blue-to-emerald gradient matching app theme

* Task indicators show the presence of scheduled tasks
* Calendar grid scrolls vertically when needed

**Mobile Considerations:**
* Fixed-position add button in the bottom right corner
* Responsive grid that maintains 7-column structure
* Simplified information density on smaller screens
* Touch-friendly day cells for adding tasks

**Information Hierarchy:**

1. Current month and year (primary temporal context)
2. Day grid showing date distribution (primary content structure)
3. Current day highlighting (for immediate orientation)
4. Task indicators (secondary content showing schedule density)
5. Navigation controls (utility for moving between time periods)

**Style and Feel:**

* Structured
* Grid-based
* Clean
* Navigable
* Month-focused
* At-a-glance
