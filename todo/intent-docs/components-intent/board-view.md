# Board View Component Intent (Kanban)

**Purpose:**

To provide a visual workflow representation of tasks using a Kanban-style board, allowing users to easily track and manage task progress through different stages with drag-and-drop functionality.

**Visual Goals:**

* **Column-Based Layout:** Present tasks in distinct columns that represent different workflow stages.
* **Visual Flow:** Clearly illustrate the progression of tasks from "To Do" to "Done" stages.
* **Drag and Drop:** Enable intuitive drag-and-drop interaction for moving tasks between columns.
* **Consistent Task Display:** Maintain the same task card design across different views for consistency.

**Key Elements & Intent:**

* **Column Structure:**
  * Two clearly defined columns: "To Do" and "Done"
  * Each column has a distinct header with semibold text
  * Columns have subtle background, border, and shadow to create visual containers
  * Columns are evenly spaced and arranged in a grid layout

* **Task Cards:**
  * Identical to those in list view for consistency
  * Maintain the same interaction patterns across views
  * Include the same information: title, tags, completion status, and actions
  * Retain hover and interaction states from list view

* **Draggable Interaction:**
  * Each task card can be dragged between columns
  * Task cards have appropriate attributes for drag-and-drop functionality
  * Visual feedback cues during drag operations

**Visual Implementation Details:**

* **Board Layout:**
  * Two-column grid with appropriate gap between columns (`gap-6`)
  * Columns take equal width (grid-cols-2)
  * Each column is a flex container to stack cards vertically

* **Column Design:**
  * White background with subtle border and shadow
  * Padding inside columns to separate content from edges
  * Column headers with proper typography treatment
  * Consistent vertical spacing between cards within columns (`gap-4`)

* **Task Status Representation:**
  * Column placement indicates task status (To Do or Done)
  * Task cards maintain their visual indicators for status:
    * Incomplete tasks have a circle icon
    * Completed tasks have a green checkmark icon, strikethrough text, and gray background

**Interaction Patterns:**

* Tasks can be dragged from one column to another to change their status
* Moving a task to the "Done" column automatically marks it as complete
* Moving a task to the "To Do" column automatically marks it as incomplete
* Task cards provide the same edit and delete functionality as in list view
* Clicking the completion indicator toggles completion state as in list view

**Relation to Other Views:**

* Shares the same navigation bar and view switching controls as list view
* Task cards maintain consistent styling and behavior across views
* Provides an alternative visualization of the same task data

**Style and Feel:**

* Organized
* Spatial
* Interactive
* Progress-Oriented
* Visual
* Dynamic
