# List View Component Intent

**Purpose:**

To present a clear, concise, and scannable listing of all tasks. Prioritize readability, visual appeal, and efficiency for quick task assessment and management.

**Visual Goals:**

* **Clarity & Organization:** Provide a straightforward representation of the entire task list with visually distinct task cards.
* **Quick Assessment:** Enable users to quickly scan and understand the status of each task through clear visual indicators.
* **Visual Hierarchy:** Create a clear hierarchy of information with proper spacing and typographic treatment.
* **Interactions:** Provide intuitive hover states and interaction cues for all interactive elements.

**Key Elements & Intent:**

* **Vertical List:** The core structure is a simple, vertically arranged list with individual task cards.
* **Task Cards:** Each task is presented as a distinct card with subtle shadows and hover effects for a modern interface feel.
* **Completion Indication:** Circle icon on the left that converts to a checkmark when completed.
* **Clear Typography:** Medium-weight font for task titles with strikethrough styling for completed tasks.
* **Tags:** Pill-shaped colored tags that represent both status (Todo/Done) and categories/metadata.

**Key Visual Principles:**

* **Card-Based Design:** Tasks presented as individual cards with subtle shadows to create visual separation.
* **Vertical Rhythm:** Consistent spacing between list items to aid scanning.
* **Color Coding:** Using blue for primary actions and status, green for completed items, and purple for metadata.
* **Hover States:** All interactive elements provide clear visual feedback on hover.

**Specific Visual Details:**

* **Background:** Clean white background for task cards against a light gray/neutral page background.
* **Card Styling:** Rounded corners, subtle shadows, and hover effects that enhance depth.

* **Actions:** Delete (trash) and edit (pen) icons that change color on hover (red for delete, blue for edit).
* **Completion States:** Completed tasks have a green checkmark icon, strikethrough text, and a slightly grayed background.

**Interaction Patterns:**

* Clicking the circle icon toggles task completion state.
* Hovering over action icons changes their color to indicate interactivity.
* Cards have a subtle shadow enhancement on hover to indicate their interactivity.

**Status Indicators:**

* **Todo Status:** Blue pill-shaped tag indicating tasks that need to be completed.
* **Done Status:** Green pill-shaped tag indicating completed tasks.
* **Due Dates:** Purple pill-shaped tags showing when tasks are due.
