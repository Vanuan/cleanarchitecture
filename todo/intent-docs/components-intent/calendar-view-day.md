# Calendar View Component Intent - Day View

**Purpose:**

To provide a detailed, hourly view of a single day's schedule, allowing users to see tasks and appointments in a time-oriented format and efficiently manage their daily schedule.

**Visual Goals:**

* **Time-Based Organization:** Display the full day broken down by hours for precise scheduling.
* **Visual Timeline:** Present a clear visual timeline for temporal awareness.
* **Task Sections:** Separate all-day tasks from time-specific scheduled events.
* **Daily Navigation:** Allow easy movement between consecutive days while maintaining context.
* **Consistent Design:** Maintain visual cohesion with other calendar views.

**Key Elements & Intent:**
