# Calendar View Component Intent - Day View

**Purpose:**

To provide a detailed, hourly view of a single day's schedule, allowing users to see tasks and appointments in a time-oriented format and efficiently manage their daily schedule.

**Visual Goals:**

* **Time-Based Organization:** Display the full day broken down by hours for precise scheduling.
* **Visual Timeline:** Present a clear visual timeline with current time indicator for temporal awareness.
* **Task Sections:** Separate all-day tasks from time-specific scheduled events.
* **Daily Navigation:** Allow easy movement between consecutive days while maintaining context.

**Key Elements & Intent:**

* **Day Header:**
  * Day of week, date, and relative time indicator ("Today", "Tomorrow", "Yesterday")
  * Week day tabs for quick navigation between days
  * Current day highlighting for immediate context awareness
  * Month and year display in the calendar header

* **All-Day Task Section:**
  * Dedicated area for tasks without specific time requirements
  * Clear visual separation from the hourly schedule
  * Add task button for quickly creating new all-day events
  * Informational message when no all-day tasks exist

* **Hourly Schedule:**
  * Consistent hour markers from morning to evening (6 AM - 7 PM)
  * Current time indicator (red line) showing the present moment
  * Sufficient height for each hour to accommodate multiple events
  * Clear hour labels along the left side

* **Controls & Navigation:**

  * Date navigation controls (Previous, Today, Next)
  * Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
